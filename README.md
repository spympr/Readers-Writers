# Readers-Writers-Problem
In this mini project we solve one of the most popular OS's problems, readers-writers problem. 

# Summary
>Simply we give to this project the number of peers,which are going to read or write of Num_Of_Entries Entries and this process will be repeated for Iteration_Times. We can control readers-writers from Ratio(Readers-Writers). After execution we can observe what happened in each Entry (number of times that have been read or written and average waiting time). Finally, we display number of (reading and writing) times of all peers and all entries, so as to check if everything went fine. 

# Execution 
You can check it out, only with execution of: bash script.sh Num_of_Peers Num_of_Entries Ratio(Readers-Writers) Iteration_Times
Note: You need to give 4 arguments with exactly this order.
